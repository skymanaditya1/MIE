                The MauTeach Project is an initiative of the Mauritius Institute of Education
                in parternship with Microsoft to bring in educators from different educational
                sectors on a common platform. The platform is a social and interactive learning
                place for educators and consists of many features that distinguishes it from a
                traditional online learning platform.

                The feature includes the ability to access and download a panoply of digital resources
                to help educators with the Integration of ICT in their teaching practice. Moreover
                educators can become a registered member of the MauTeach community. They can bring
                their contributions by uploading their resources to the variety of resources available
                in the upload section.
